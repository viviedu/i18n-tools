# i18n-tools

## How to add as a dependency

To add this private git npm module as a dev dependency you can use something like:

    `yarn add --dev git+ssh://git@github.com:viviedu/i18n-tools.git#1.0.1`

To update the version of this tool you need to push a git version tag for that to work as well.

    git push origin tag 1.0.1

Itâ€™s recommended you put that into your .zshrc or .env or equivalent.
